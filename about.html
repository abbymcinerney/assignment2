              My name is Abby (short for Abigail), I'm 19 years old and live in Hertfordshire.
              <br>I'm currently an undergraduate student in my first year at the University of Northampton, where I study Business Computing (Web Design).
              <br>I chose to study this after taking an interest in computing while taking my GCSE's. I find computing, coding in particular, very rewarding
              which is what motivates me within the subject. 
              Throughout school art was never a strong point of mine so I found that programming/web development was a 
              better way for me to get creative. 
              <br>I hope to graduate University, not only with high grades but also with as much

              industry experience as possible. During my first year of Sixth Form I visited a Computercenter office in Budapest to shadow some of their
              employees in different departments. 
              <br>This was the first time I saw the way computing was applied within a large company and allowed me to work out which
              aspects of computing I was most interested in as well as the aspects that were not as suited to me. This was an extremely valuable experience to me and I hope
              to complete more work shadowing/experiences in the future.
